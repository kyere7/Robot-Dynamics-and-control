# **Robot Dynamics and Control**

This repository contains my notes, exercises, and implementations from the course **Robot Dynamics and Control**, a rigorous introduction to the mathematical foundations of how robots move and how their motion can be controlled. The course is based on the classic textbook *Robot Dynamics and Control (2nd Edition)* by Spong, Hutchinson, and Vidyasagar, and focuses on modeling, analyzing, and controlling robotic manipulators.

The material blends nonlinear dynamics, multibody mechanics, and modern control theory to build a complete framework for understanding real robotic systems. Both theoretical foundations and practical methods used in industrial and research‑grade robots are emphasized.
